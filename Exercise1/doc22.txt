The objective of this book is to provide an up-to-date survey of developments in computer
security. Central problems that confront security designers and security administrators
include defining the threats to computer and network systems, evaluating the relative risks
of these threats, and developing cost-effective and user friendly countermeasures.
The following basic themes unify the discussion:
	
	
	
•	 Principles: Although the scope of this book is broad, there are a number of basic prin-
ciples that appear repeatedly as themes and that unify this field. Examples are issues
relating to authentication and access control. The book highlights these principles and
examines their application in specific areas of computer security.
•	 Design approaches: The book examines alternative approaches to meeting specific
computer security requirements.
•	 Standards: Standards have come to assume an increasingly important, indeed domi-
nant, role in this field. An understanding of the current status and future direction of
technology requires a comprehensive discussion of the related standards.xiv    Preface
	
•	 Real-world examples: A number of chapters include a section that shows the practical
application of that chapter’s principles in a real-world environment.he major goal of this text is to make it as effective a teaching tool for this exciting and fast-moving
subject as possible. This goal is reflected both in the structure of the book and in the supporting
material. The text is accompanied by the following supplementary material to aid the instructor:

•	 Projects manual: Project resources including documents and portable software, plus sug-
gested project assignments for all of the project categories listed in the following section.
•	 Solutions manual: Solutions to end-of-chapter Review Questions and Problems.
•	 PowerPoint slides: A set of slides covering all chapters, suitable for use in lecturing.
•	 PDF files: Reproductions of all figures and tables from the book.
•	 Test bank: A chapter-by-chapter set of questions.
•	 Sample syllabuses: The text contains more material than can be conveniently covered
in one semester. Accordingly, instructors are provided with several sample syllabuses
that guide the use of the text within limited time. These samples are based on real-
world experience by professors with the first edition.
