Abstract Evolution algorithms are often well-suited for optimization problems involving several often conflicting objectives Since 1985 various evolutionary approaches to multiobjective optimization have been developed that are capable of searching for multiple solutions concurrently in a single run However the few comparative studies of different methods presented up to now remain mostly qualitative and are often restricted to a few approaches In this paper four multiobjective EAs are compared quantitatively where an extended 0/1 knapsack problem is taken as a basis Furthermore we introduce a new evolutionary approach to multicriteria optimization the strength Pareto EA that combines several features of previous multiobjective EAs in a unique manner It is characterized by storing nondominated solutions externally in a second continuously updated population
